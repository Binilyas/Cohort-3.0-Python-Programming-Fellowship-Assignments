# WELCOME TO PYTHON-CRASH COURSE CODE 

## **CHAPTER - VARIABLE, AND SIMPLE DATA TYPE**

#### **WHAT IS VARIABLE**

_Variable in python is like assigning value to somethings like in form of mathematics "Saying let x = 7 or let y = 7" in this case take your x or y as your variable name while 7 is the value assigned to variable name._
##### **for examples**
first_name =_"Adigun"_

surname =_"Adigson"_

**In above example**

_the surname and first name are called the variable name_

while _Adgigun_ and _Adigson_ are called the value assigned to the variable
## RULES IN NAMING VARIABLE 

* Variable name can contain letter, numbers, and underscore. the name can start with Alphabet or underscore but not with numbers. like first_name or _First__name NOT 1_first__name
* The variable name should be short and descriptive i.e student_name is better than s_n and first_name is better than f_n
* Avoid space in variable name use underscore to seperate text as space in variable name could cause error for example **greeting_message** work _while_ **greeting message** cause error BECAUSE OF SPACE BETWEEN
* Becareful when using lower case (l) and upper case (O) because they could be confuse with number **(1)** and **(0)** respectiverly
